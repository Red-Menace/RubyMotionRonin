# RubyMotionRonin

A few rogue macOS projects:

- **User Defaults** - a simple example using **NSUserDefaults** and a preferences window
- **osx template** - a cleaned up and (slightly) enhanced macOS "Hello, World" project template
- **ExampleIB** - an example demonstrating the use of an Objective-C Xcode project for the user interface
- **Help Book Sample** - not really RubyMotion specific, but a sample help book that can be dropped into your projects.
